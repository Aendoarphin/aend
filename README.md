# TLDR
My personal website which uses sleek and epic front-end tools. I will be adding more content to this site.

## Summary
A Vite + React + Typescript web app to showcase my skills. Discover the technologies I work with, read about my priorities, and stay up to date with my ongoing projects.

## Deployment

<a href="https://vercel.com/">
<img src="./public/vercel-logotype-light.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" height="64">

</div>

## Styling
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Faster component creation
